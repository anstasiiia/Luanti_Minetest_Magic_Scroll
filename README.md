# Magic Scrolls

**The Magic Scrolls mod adds magical scrolls that grant temporary effects to the player.
Each effect lasts for a limited time (30 seconds by default) and is displayed in the HUD with a countdown timer.
A player can only use one scroll at a time (a new effect cancels the previous one).**

## Available Scrolls
### Speed Scroll (magic_scrolls:speed_scroll)

* Doubles the player's movement speed.
* Restores normal speed after the effect ends.

### Jump Scroll (magic_scrolls:jump_scroll)

* Doubles the player's jump height.
* Restores normal jump settings after the effect ends.

### Invulnerability Scroll (magic_scrolls:invuln_scroll)

* Player takes no damage from enemies or falling.
* Normal damage is restored after the effect ends.
